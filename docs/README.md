# Nuxtless Technical Audits

This folder contains agent-generated reference audits created during the early optimization phase of Nuxtless.

They are not part of the active codebase but serve as initial deep-dive analyses to guide future improvements.

- **critical-path.md** — full sitemap-level breakdown of all flows  
- **test-blueprint.md** — proposed structure for unit, integration, and E2E tests  
- **bundle-audit.md** — inspection of client bundle composition

Use these documents as starting points rather than final specifications.
